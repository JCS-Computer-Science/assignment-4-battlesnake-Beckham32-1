/*
goal:
this d* snake should feel dominant and aggressive, taking any opportunity to eliminate other snakes

order:
    - d* search for path to food, if blocked try different path/food (always running to check for victims)
    - no food reachable, compare snake length to others to target smaller snakes (attempt to predict locations to eliminate)
    -
